  <p class="para">The G20 Agriculture Deputies Group was created during the French Presidency in 2011 to deal with volatility in global food prices. It has since become an important forum to enhance cooperation among the G20 members on agriculture related issues critical for achieving UN 2030 agenda, especially the goal of zero hunger (SDG 2). The working group facilitates information exchange and cooperation on a range of global issues such as food security, nutrition, antimicrobial resistance, food waste and loss, sustainability, and resilient and inclusive food value chains.</p>

  <h1 class="heading">Disaster Risk Reduction</h1>
  <p class="para">G20 countries have a high level of exposure to disaster risk, with a combined estimated Annual Average Loss of $218 billion or 9% of their average annual investment in infrastructure. G20 Leaders’ declarations have from time to time acknowledged the importance of disaster risk reduction and resilience. However, the issue has not been addressed by the G20 in a comprehensive and sustained manner. A new working group on Disaster Risk Reduction has therefore been established under India's Presidency to encourage collective work by the G20, undertake multi-disciplinary research and exchange best practices on disaster risk reduction.</p>
